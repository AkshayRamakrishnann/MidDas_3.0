# Depth Estimation with DPT (Depth Prediction Transformer)
This repository contains code for performing depth estimation on images using the DPT (Depth Prediction Transformer) model. Depth estimation is the task of predicting the depth map of a scene from a single image, which can be useful for various applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality.

## Overview
In this repository, we utilize the DPT model provided by Intel through the Transformers library to perform depth estimation on images. The DPT model is a transformer-based architecture specifically designed for depth prediction tasks.

## Setup
To run the code in this repository, you'll need to have Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using pip:
