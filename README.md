# Depth Estimation with DPT (Depth Prediction Transformer)
This repository contains code for performing depth estimation on images using the DPT (Depth Prediction Transformer) model. Depth estimation is the task of predicting the depth map of a scene from a single image, which can be useful for various applications such as autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality.The DPT-Hybrid architecture, also known as MiDaS 3.0, represents a state-of-the-art approach for depth estimation in computer vision. This architecture builds upon the success of previous models like MiDaS (Monocular Depth Estimation in Autonomous Driving Scenarios) and DPT (Depth Prediction Transformer). The "Hybrid" aspect refers to the combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transformer-based architectures, merging their strengths to improve depth estimation accuracy and efficiency.

At its core, the DPT-Hybrid architecture incorporates a CNN backbone, typically based on a pre-trained ResNet or similar network, to extract feature representations from the input image. These features capture hierarchical patterns and semantic information essential for depth estimation tasks. The CNN backbone processes the input image to generate a feature map, which serves as the input to the transformer-based module.

The transformer module in the DPT-Hybrid architecture further refines the feature representations generated by the CNN backbone. Transformers excel in capturing long-range dependencies and modeling context across different regions of the image. This module enables the model to reason about spatial relationships and global context, which is crucial for accurate depth prediction.

By combining CNNs and transformers, the DPT-Hybrid architecture achieves a balance between local feature extraction and global context understanding. This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both architectures, resulting in improved depth estimation performance across various scenes and scenarios. Additionally, the DPT-Hybrid architecture often incorporates techniques such as multi-scale processing, attention mechanisms, and self-supervised learning to further enhance depth estimation accuracy and robustness.

## Huggingface X Intel
The collaboration between Intel and Hugging Face has been particularly impactful in the context of models like DPT (Depth Prediction Transformer). Here's how the collaboration benefits this specific model:

1)Optimized Performance: Intel's expertise in hardware optimization and deep learning frameworks allows for the efficient execution of Hugging Face's DPT model on Intel's hardware architectures. Through optimizations for Intel CPUs and accelerators, such as Intel Xeon processors and Neural Compute Stick devices, the DPT model can achieve improved performance and scalability.

2)Accelerated Development: Intel provides support and resources to Hugging Face for model development and optimization. This collaboration enables Hugging Face to leverage Intel's tools and technologies to accelerate the development and refinement of the DPT model, ensuring it meets performance standards across a range of Intel hardware platforms.

## Overview
In this repository, we utilize the DPT model provided by Intel through the Transformers library to perform depth estimation on images. The DPT model is a transformer-based architecture specifically designed for depth prediction tasks.

## Code Explaination
The script utilizes the Hugging Face Transformers library to access the pre-trained DPT model, specifically the DPTImageProcessor and DPTForDepthEstimation classes. Initially, an image is loaded from a URL using the PIL library. Subsequently, the DPTImageProcessor preprocesses the image, converting it into a format suitable for the DPT model. The preprocessed image is then fed into the DPTForDepthEstimation model, which predicts the depth map of the scene depicted in the image. After obtaining the depth prediction, the script performs interpolation to resize the predicted depth map to match the original image's dimensions. Finally, the interpolated depth map is converted back into an image format and displayed. This script serves as a practical example of using pre-trained deep learning models for computer vision tasks, specifically depth estimation, showcasing the capabilities of the DPT model for understanding the spatial layout of scenes captured in images. Additionally, it demonstrates how to integrate Hugging Face's Transformers library for seamless access to pre-trained models and processing pipelines.

## Output
The output of the provided code will be an image representing the estimated depth map of the scene depicted in the input image. This depth map provides information about the distance of objects from the camera in the original image. The output image will display varying shades of gray, where lighter shades correspond to objects closer to the camera, and darker shades represent objects farther away. The depth map is generated using the Depth Prediction Transformer (DPT) model, which leverages deep learning techniques to infer the spatial layout of the scene and estimate depth accurately. By visualizing the depth map, users can gain insights into the three-dimensional structure of the scene captured in the input image, enabling applications such as augmented reality, autonomous navigation, and scene understanding.
